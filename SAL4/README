The SAL LabVIEW Monitor that builds here is the bridge between 
SAL3 based EUI and SAL4 semantics.

When the MTM1M3 XML changes, rebuild as usual with the salgenerator, then copy
the SAL_MTM1M3* files here. Then make sure the directory is accessible as
$SAL_WORK_DIR/m1m3/labview and rebuild the monitor with 

    make -f Makefile.sacpp_MTM1M3_labview
